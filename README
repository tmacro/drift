drift: the cluster aware automatic media re-encoder.
Drift monitors a directory for file to convert, converts them to a specified
format, copies the converted file to a output directory, and finallly removing
the original file.

Multiple instances of drift can be run, either on the same machine, or on a
networked cluster of machines. drift instances coordinate their efforts using etcd
for distributed locking.

Clustering can be enabled by setting CLUSTER_MODE to true in config.json
An etcd host (required) and (optionaly) port can be specified in config.json as
	ETCD_HOST
	ETCD_PORT
The root directory used for locks is specified using ETCD_ROOT

CODEC_VIDEO and CODEC_AUDIO specify the codecs to reencode to.

WORKERS defines the number of conversions to run per drift instance

FFMPEG_PRESET and FFMPEG_CRF define video encoding options

AUDIO_BR defines the adio bitrate, end number in 'k' for kilohertz
